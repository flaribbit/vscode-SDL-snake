# vscode SDL project with lodepng

SDLimage provides complete support for reading image files, but the most used image format for game production is png images, so this SDL empty project only supports png.

The project uses vscode as the development environment.

The project file already comes with all the dependencies needed for the build. To build and run, just type:

    make&&a
